Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
ANSWER:
Version control in Git can be described as the process that handles the tracking and managing of all changes to code, documents, or other digital content over time. 
The following are some of the Git concepts;
1. Track changes- Records all  modifications and includes details on who made the changes and when.
2. Branch and merge: Create separate lines of development (branches) and combine them (merge) when ready.
3. Revert changes: Easily undo mistakes or roll back to previous versions.
4. Collaborate: Work with others on the same project, managing multiple contributions.

GitHub enhances version control for developers by:
1. By providing a cloud-based repository for Storing code and version history online,it is easily accessible from anywhere.

3. using its pull requests it enables streamlining of code reviews and discussions before merging changes.
4. Using issue tracking allows developers to track bugs, feature requests, and tasks.
5. Through continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) there Automated testing, building, and deployment processes.
6. As a community platform it fosters open-source collaboration, feedback, and recognition.

What are branches in GitHub, and why are they important? Describe the process of creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch.
ANSWER:
Branches in GitHub are separate lines of development in a repository which allows the coexistance of multiple versions of the codebase. They are important for:
-Isolating changes which allows developers to experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
-Collaboratio enabling multiple developers to work on different branches simultaneously.
-Testing and validation for verifying changes before merging them into the main branch.

STEPS for creating a branch, making changes, and merging it back into the main branch:
Step 1: Create a new branch
- Use the command git branch <branch_name> or create a new branch on GitHub.
- This creates a copy of the main branch (usually "main" or "master").
Step 2: Switch to the new branch
- Use git checkout <branch_name> to switch to the new branch.
- Make changes, commit, and push to the new branch.
Step 3: Make changes and commit
- Edit files, add new features, or fix bugs.
- Commit changes using git commit -m "<commit_message>".
- Push changes to the remote branch using git push origin <branch_name>.
Step 4: Merge the branch
- Switch to the main branch using git checkout main.
- Use git merge <branch_name> to merge the changes from the new branch.
- Resolve any conflicts, commit, and push to the main branch.
Step 5: Delete the branch (please note that this is optional)
- Once merged, delete the branch using git branch -d <branch_name>.

What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate code reviews and collaboration? Outline the steps to create and review a pull request.
ANSWER:
A pull request (PR) in GitHub can be describeed as a way of proposing changes to a repository's codebase by submitting a request to merge a branch of changes into the main branch. 
It facilitates code reviews and collaboration by;
1. Allowing developers to review and discuss changes before merging.
2. Enabling multiple reviewers to provide feedback and approval.
3. Providing a clear record of changes and discussions.

STEPS TO CREATE A PULL REQUEST;
1. Start by creating a new branch for your changes.
2. Make changes, commit, and push to the new branch.
3. Navigate to the repository on GitHub.
4. Click "New pull request" and select the branch.
5. Add a title and description for the PR.
6. Assign reviewers and optionally add labels or milestones.
7. Submit the PR.
STEPS TO REVIEW A PULL REQUEST;
1. Receive notification of the PR submission.
2. Review the changes in the PR, using GitHub's diff view.
3. Leave comments and feedback on specific lines of code.
4. Approve or request changes using GitHub's review tools.
5. Discuss with the submitter to address any questions or concerns.
6. Merge the PR once approved and tested.

Explain what GitHub Actions are and how they can be used to automate workflows. Provide an example of a simple CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
ANSWER:
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) tool that automates workflows directly within GitHub repositories.
It allows developers to automate tasks, such as the building and testing of code,running scripts,deploying applications and sending of notifications.

EXAMPLE OF A SIMPLE CI.CD PIPELINE USING GitHub Actions on Windows:
Workflow File: .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: windows-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Build and test
        run: npm run build && npm run test
      - name: Deploy to IIS
        uses: actions/deploy-to-iis@v1
        with:
          website-name: MyWebsite **replace with actual website
          app-pool-name: MyAppPool **replace with application pool name

This workflow will:
-Trigger on push events to the main branch
-Check out the repository code
-Install dependencies using npm
-Build and test the application
-Deploys to an IIS (Internet Information Services) server on Windows
